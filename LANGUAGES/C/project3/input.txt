Topic: Guest speakers

Dr. Evil - My class seems to be having too much fun this summer, so I was thinking of 
making things a little more more boring by inviting guest speakers to lecture for the 
remainder of the semester. Below is a list of speakers and their intended topic; let me
know what you think. Obvously these are for your eyes only. 

1. Ben Kenobi - Not the Segfault You Are Looking For
2. Bigfoot - Reverse Networking: The art of staying hidden
3. Oliver Queen - Don't Fail Your Class - It Hurts
4. Rick Sanchez - Grandparenting 101
